# Quiz Calculation Fixes - Teacher Dashboard

## Problem Identified
The teacher dashboard was showing incorrect quiz averages, particularly in the "ממוצע בחינות שהושלמו" (completed quizzes average) column. Students who scored 100% on a quiz were seeing much lower percentages.

## Root Causes Found
1. **Incomplete completed quiz filtering**: The original logic wasn't properly filtering out zero-score attempts when calculating the "completed only" average
2. **Lack of debugging**: No logging to identify what data was being processed
3. **Fallback method issues**: The learndash_user_activity fallback wasn't distinguishing between overall and completed averages

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Debugging
- Added comprehensive logging to track quiz calculation process
- Debug messages show exactly what data is found for each student
- Logs are written to WordPress error log and can be viewed in wp-content/debug.log

### 2. Improved Completed Quiz Calculation
- Added a secondary query that specifically targets only successful quiz attempts (earned_points > 0)
- If the primary calculation shows 0% for completed quizzes but overall average > 0%, the system now recalculates using only successful attempts

### 3. Better Fallback Method
- Improved the learndash_user_activity fallback to properly separate overall vs completed averages
- Only counts non-zero percentages for the completed average calculation

## Files Modified
1. `simple-teacher-dashboard.php` - Main plugin file with improved quiz calculation
2. `simple-teacher-dashboard-improved.php` - New enhanced version with sorting functionality
3. `debug-quiz-calculation.php` - Debug tool to analyze individual student quiz data

## How to Test the Fixes

### Step 1: Enable Debug Logging
Add this to your wp-config.php:
```php
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
```

### Step 2: Test with Known Students
1. Access the debug tool: `/wp-content/plugins/simple-teacher-dashboard/debug-quiz-calculation.php`
2. Select a student who you know has taken quizzes
3. Compare the manual calculations with what the dashboard shows

### Step 3: Check Debug Logs
- View wp-content/debug.log for detailed quiz calculation logs
- Look for messages starting with "[QUIZ DEBUG]"

### Step 4: Verify Dashboard Results
1. Load the teacher dashboard
2. Select a group with students who have quiz data
3. Check that the "ממוצע בחינות שהושלמו" column shows correct percentages

## Expected Results After Fix

### Before Fix:
- Student with 1 quiz at 100%: Showed ~13% or other incorrect low percentage
- Group average: Incorrectly low (like 13.6% instead of proper average)

### After Fix:
- Student with 1 quiz at 100%: Should show 100.0% in completed column
- Student with mixed scores (e.g., 0%, 100%): Should show 50% overall, 100% completed
- Group averages: Should reflect actual quiz performance

## Additional Features Added

### Sorting Functionality
The improved version includes:
- Clickable column headers to sort by name, email, course completion, or quiz scores
- Visual sort indicators (arrows)
- Maintains sort state while browsing

### Better Error Handling
- More robust handling of edge cases (no data, zero scores, etc.)
- Clearer "אין נתונים" (No Data) indicators
- Improved CSS styling for different score ranges

## Troubleshooting

### If You Still See Incorrect Averages:
1. Check the debug logs to see what data is being processed
2. Use the debug tool to manually verify calculations
3. Ensure the learndash_pro_quiz_statistic tables contain the expected data
4. Consider that some very old quiz attempts might not have proper data structure

### If Debug Logs Don't Appear:
1. Verify WP_DEBUG and WP_DEBUG_LOG are enabled
2. Check that wp-content/debug.log is writable
3. Try accessing the debug tool directly to see raw data

## Database Queries Used

### Primary Method (Pro Quiz Tables):
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(ref.statistic_ref_id) as total_attempts,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ref.quiz_post_id) as unique_quizzes,
    -- Overall: includes all attempts
    COALESCE(ROUND(AVG(
        CASE 
            WHEN quiz_scores.total_questions > 0 
            THEN (quiz_scores.earned_points / quiz_scores.total_questions) * 100
            ELSE 0
        END
    ), 1), 0) as overall_success_rate,
    -- Completed: only attempts with earned_points > 0
    COALESCE(ROUND(AVG(
        CASE 
            WHEN quiz_scores.total_questions > 0 AND quiz_scores.earned_points > 0 
            THEN (quiz_scores.earned_points / quiz_scores.total_questions) * 100
            ELSE NULL
        END
    ), 1), 0) as completed_only_rate
FROM wp_learndash_pro_quiz_statistic_ref ref
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT 
        statistic_ref_id,
        SUM(points) as earned_points,
        COUNT(*) as total_questions
    FROM wp_learndash_pro_quiz_statistic
    GROUP BY statistic_ref_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 0
) quiz_scores ON ref.statistic_ref_id = quiz_scores.statistic_ref_id
WHERE ref.user_id = ?
```

### Fallback Method (Activity Table):
Uses learndash_user_activity with activity_type = 'quiz' and processes the percentage from activity_meta.

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the debug logs after implementing the fix
2. Test with multiple students across different groups
3. Verify that the group averages are now calculating correctly
4. Consider implementing the improved version with sorting if the basic fix works well

## Contact
If issues persist, provide:
1. Debug log entries for affected students
2. Output from the debug tool for specific student IDs
3. Screenshots of the dashboard showing incorrect vs expected results
